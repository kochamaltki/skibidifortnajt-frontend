# Project Setup
### Installing Dependencies
To install all the required dependencies run the following commands in the project's root directory:
```sh
npm install
```

### Rendering the Website
To locally host the website run the following commands:
```sh
npm run dev
```

# Contributing
### Create a branch for the feature you want to add and name it accordingly. 
Make sure you have the newest code to minimize conflicts by first pulling the most recent code from the main branch.
```sh
git pull origin main
git branch -b your_branch_name
```

### Commit all your changes.
Make sure you commit your changes frequently. Ideally commit all major changes separately.
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### Push your updates and merge them on github.
You can also delete your branch locally as it is no longer needed (unless you want to further develop said branch).
```sh
git push origin your_branch_name
```
```sh
git branch --delete your_branch_name
```
