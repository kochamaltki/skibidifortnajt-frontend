# Contributing
### Create a branch for the feature you want to add and name it accordingly
Make sure you have the newest code to minimize conflicts by first pulling the most recent code from the main branch.
```sh
git pull origin main
git branch -b your_branch_name
```
Alternatively you can use the script provided by the repo which pulls the most recent main version and creates a new branch from that:
```sh
./new-branch your_branch_name
```
The script above will also create a `.branchdata` file to save the branch name and allow you to use the two other scripts.

### Commit all your changes
Make sure you commit your changes frequently. Ideally commit all major changes separately.
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### Push your updates to github
To make sure you don't lose your progress you can save it independently of your local machine on github.
```sh
git push origin your_branch_name
```
Instead you can run the push script which will allow you to not remember the branch name. (only if you used ./new-branch)
```sh
./push-branch
```

### Merge your branch on github
If your feature is done and production-ready you can merge your developement branch with the main one on github. Once you've merged your changes you can delete your old branch.
```sh
git branch --delete your_branch_name
```
You can also use the provided script if you don't want to remember the branch name. (only if you used ./new-branch)
```sh
./delete-branch
```

# Testing
### To make sure your component works remember to write a test for it
To create a test for your component create a `Component.test.ts` file in the component's directory. An example test checking if the component renders would look like this:
```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
import { render } from '@testing-library/svelte'
import Component from './Component.svelte'

describe('Component.svelte', () => {
	it('check if the component renders', () => {
		const { container } = render(Component);
		expect(container).toBeTruthy();
	})
})
```
